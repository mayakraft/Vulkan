# Vulkan from scratch

I'm learning Vulkan. Here are some resources that I'm using:

## Usage

All numbered folders are self-contained projects. Navigate into any folder and type `make` and then run the program (usually `./a.out`).

But, it probably will not work if you don't follow this setup.

## MacOS setup

Prerequisites: Xcode command line tools. I'm using makefiles, no need to actually run Xcode or install CMake. But, I think Xcode needs to be installed anyway.

Install [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#mac), which installs MoltenVK. I installed Vulkan into `/Library`

> my folder structure looked like: `/Library/VulkanSDK/1.3.268.1/macOS/include/vulkan/vulkan.h`

### system environment variables

I ran these. I suspect the first line is what mattered the most.

```
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/VulkanSDK/1.3.268.1/macOS/lib
```

```
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/Library/VulkanSDK/1.3.268.1/MoltenVK/dylib/macOS/MoltenVK_icd.json
```

```
export VULKAN_SDK=/Library/VulkanSDK/1.3.268.1
```

### dependencies

my pkgconfig was messed up. I had to install

```
brew install zeromq
brew install pkgconfig
```

Not needed for all dev environments, but I will use GLFW and GLM, so, install these:

```
brew install glfw
brew install glm
```

due to unrelated issues that I fixed, I ran this, but I suspect that I entirely did not need to:

```
brew install glew glfw3
brew install --cask xquartz
```

### project setup

Every project has an `.env` file. You have to modify it to match the location of the Vulkan SDK on your computer.

## Windows, Linux setup
